This project aims to provide an economic opportunity for schools and parents to maintain a safe environment for kids to travel to their schools every day without having their parents worry about their safety.    

Parents are struggling to find the timing of when their kids are to be picked and dropped off.

Parents contact the driver assistant through phone calls to find where the bus is located and whether their kids are on-board.

Communication between parents and school admins is quite ineffective. Hence, they rely on Whats App and other messaging solutions.

No available solution in the market for schools currently with affordable cost.
